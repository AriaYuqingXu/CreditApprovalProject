## Project Question
The question that we are planning to investigate is determining if one is qualified for a credit card on the basis of evaluating the fairness of the current credit system. Overall, we are focusing on credit score evaluation.

## Project Dataset

We found the dataset on this [website](https://lhttps://ffiec.cfpb.gov/data-browser/data/2020?category=states&items=NY&leis=7H6GLXDRUGQFU57RNE97)

The dataset that we are planning to use is a 2020 HMDA Dataset in the state of New  York, and the financial institution would be JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association - 7H6GLXDRUGQFU57RNE97. It contains 99 columns, including ethnicity, race, loan type, income, action taken, preapproval, debt to income ratio, and so on, which is sufficient for us to find the factors that contribute to the current system. Thus, this data set will allow us to answer this question since it provides a large amount of data, which would be enough for us to divide them into a training set, a validation set, and a testing set that would help us develop our new scheme and test the accuracy. 

## Importance of the Question
This problem is important because credit scores help banks, loaners, and others justify or evaluate a person’s ability to return their debt enabling them to make the right decisions in credit approval, and help disadvantaged individuals/groups to get credits approved. Credit evaluation would help on minimizing credit risk, maximizing banks’ profits, and protecting margins.

## Reasons Why We Will Achieve the Goal
We are likely to succeed because we have a very large dataset which helps avoiding biased results and unrepresented sample space. We would also use the 
[data field webiste](https://ffiec.cfpb.gov/documentation/2018/lar-data-fields/) that they provided to better understand the dataset and interpret data values. Besides, we could use the methods that we’ve learned in class such as classification, least-square, regression methods, etc. Moreover, credit evaluation has been a repeating problem that others have attempted to solve, so we understand our final model is definitely feasible but it will be a matter of accuracy.
