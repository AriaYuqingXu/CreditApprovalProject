Credit scores help banks, loaners, and others justify or evaluate a person’s ability to return their debt enabling them to make the right decisions in loan approval, and help disadvantaged individuals/groups to get loan approved. Loan evaluation would help in minimizing loan risk, maximizing banks’ profits, and protecting margins. The goal of our project is to evaluate the fairness of the current loan system at Bank of America across the United States in 2018 with data provided by HMDA Data Browser, and to develop a new system that is fair, which penalizes certain unfair features towards loan approval.
